# Benches are mostly usefull on the local machine to keep track of performances
# evolutions (possible improvements, regressions, ...).
# This scripts is nonetheless useful:
# * to document how to setup and exec bench on a machine
# * to automatically perform benches (but no comparison with previous one's)
#
# To understand this scripts, look at the comments in deploy.yml or test.yml.
